                        <h1 class="sub-text customer-review">This is my second rave review of Joyce. I don't want to go anywhere else, so I hope she lives forever. Her haircuts are wonderful, and a few months ago I decided to get a permanent to bolster my fine hair. I hadn't had one for decades, so was a bit nervous beforehand as well as eager. But Joyce, with whom I by now have a very friendly relationship, making being there a pleasure, asked me if I wanted the permanent "relaxed or tight?" I hadn't realized there was such a thing as a "relaxed" permanent, and chose that option. The process was painless, and not even smelly. And since that time, I have loved my hair, how it looks, how it functions. I can wash it and let it air dry and have lots of waves that look uber casual, or I can set it and then comb it out and revel in the illusion that I have lots of controlledly wild and wonderful hair. Go to Joyce. Her environment is deceptively functional, but what you'll get in terms of your hair will be just what you want. She knows the art of hair.</h1>
